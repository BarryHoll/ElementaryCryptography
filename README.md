A command line Caesar Shift solution in C#.

Requires two text files to run:

cyphertext.txt contains the text to be decyphered: wklvblvbsuredeo*bqrwbwkhbehvwbvdpsohbribhqjolvkbwrbghf*skhubexwblwvbwkhbrqo*brqhblyhbjrw
alphabeth.txt contains the plaintext alphabeth and any other characters used in the cypher (above): plaintext=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz *

They both need to be in the same directory as the compiled exe (so 'bin' bolder).

The text file solution.txt will be generated and should read something like this:

Date:07/05/2015 20:16:28

Original alphabeth: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz *

Original cyphertext: wklvblvbsuredeo*bqrwbwkhbehvwbvdpsohbribhqjolvkbwrbghf*skhubexwblwvbwkhbrqo*brqhblyhbjrw

Shifted alphabeth: defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz *abc
